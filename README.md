## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the game which is to match 16 pair of the cards and learn more about how to play it and win the game.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the welcome screen on the game and just press any button to begin.
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look how to match the cards before the time runs off.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to beat the game with less flips and more time.
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to beat the game.
        

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used the Riddler character in the comics is green, and purple.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Anton font is the main font used throughout the whole game with Oswald as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the game correctly. Anton is a pretty strange font, so it is the best for theme game based on the riddler.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be catch in the eye and also minimal. It also has a villain twist, aesthetic.
