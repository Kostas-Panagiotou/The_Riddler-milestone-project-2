## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look how to match the cards before the time runs off.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used the Riddler character in the comics is green, and purple.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Anton font is the main font used throughout the whole game with Oswald as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the game correctly. Anton is a pretty strange font, so it is the best for theme game based on the riddler.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be catch in the eye and also minimal. It also has a villain twist, aesthetic.
